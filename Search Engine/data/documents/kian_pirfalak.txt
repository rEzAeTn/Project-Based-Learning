Kian Pirfalak (Persian: کیان پیرفلک; c. 2013 – November 16, 2022) was an Iranian child who was killed in a shooting by the security forces of Islamic Republic of Iran in his parent's vehicle in the city of Izeh in Iran.[1][2][3] His father Meysam Pirfalak was also critically injured in the assault and was hospitalized.[4][5] His mother and other family members who witnessed the incident blame the attack on Iranian security forces.[6] Islamic Republic news agencies, including IRNA, blamed his death on terrorists, circulating a statement attributed to ISIS, alleging that the group has claimed the deadly shooting that killed him.[7] BBC Monitoring, however, investigated the statement and concluded that it was fake.[8]

Pirfalak’s death sparked a nationwide outrage against the government and its use of extreme lethal force against protestors.[9][10][11] He is considered the youngest known victim (either 9 or 10-years old) of suppressing the Mahsa Amini protests.[9][12][13]
