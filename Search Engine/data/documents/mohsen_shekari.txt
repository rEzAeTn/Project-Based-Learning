Mohsen Shekari (Persian: محسن شکاری; died 8 December 2022) was a 23-year-old Iranian man who was executed by the state of Iran after being convicted of injuring a member of Iran's Basij militia and being accused of Moharebeh, an Arabic word translating to "waging war against God."

Shekari's death is noteworthy for being the first known state-sanctioned execution to have taken place as a direct result of the 2022 Mahsa Amini protests. His execution drew immediate condemnation from human rights organizations who expressed concerns that Shekari's execution, as well as the subsequent execution of Majidreza Rahnavard four days later, would catalyze a rash of state executions of protesters.[1]
