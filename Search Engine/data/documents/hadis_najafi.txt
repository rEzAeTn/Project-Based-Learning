Hadis Najafi (Persian: حدیث نجفی, January 5, 2000 – September 21, 2022) was an Iranian woman who died after being struck by gunfire in Mehrshahr, Karaj, during the 2022 Iranian protests following the death of Mahsa Amini. Her death has been widely reported in international media, and like Amini before her, Najafi also became a symbol of female empowerment and the ongoing protests against the Iranian government.

Hadis Najafi was born in Karaj[1] on 5 January 2000.[2][3] She was the fourth child of the family, having three older sisters and one younger brother.[2] Her parents were born in Mianeh in the East Azerbaijan province.[1] The family has Iranian Azerbaijani ethnic background.[4] Najafi had a diploma in fashion design and worked as a cashier at a restaurant in Mehrshahr, Karaj.[2]

Najafi had joined the Mahsa Amini protests of September 2022, which were sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini, who died due to injuries while in police custody. Amini was accused by police of violating the mandatory hijab law, and related demonstrations have shown wide support for increasing women's rights in Iran. Najafi participated in protests in Karaj.[5] Najafi had no known prior engagement in activist causes and had not previously spoken openly on women's rights in Iran.[6] On the night of 21 September, she sent a video to a friend in which she said "I like to think that when I think about this a few years later I'll be pleased I joined the protest."[7] She left her house around thirty minutes before she was killed.[2]
